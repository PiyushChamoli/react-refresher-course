Earlier Monolith architecture was used, which was basically one big project and everything will be built inside it and every time a change was done the whole big project was compiled and run.
Nowadays microservices architecture is used which is every service is working on it's own and having it's own project and all services come together to form a big whole project. This is also referred to sepration of concern and each service following it's job is referred to as single responsibility principle.
Different micro services can be deployed on different ports and these ports can be mapped to different services and by doing calls to differnt urls microservices can interact with each other.
